# Drop Probability Calculation Mechanics

## I. Core Drop Probability Mechanism

### Primary Drop Calculation Tables
1. `droplist`: Primary drop configuration
2. `npc`: Monster/Enemy metadata
3. `probability_by_spell`: Advanced probability modifiers

### Basic Drop Probability Structure
```sql
SELECT 
    mobId,
    mobname_kr AS monster_name,
    itemId,
    itemname_kr AS item_name,
    chance AS base_drop_chance,
    min AS minimum_drop_amount,
    max AS maximum_drop_amount,
    Enchant AS drop_enchant_level
FROM droplist
```

## II. Probability Calculation Layers

### 1. Base Probability Calculation
```sql
-- Simplified Drop Probability Calculation
DROP_PROBABILITY = (
    base_chance / 100000  -- Converts chance to percentage
) * (
    1 + MODIFIER_FACTORS
)
```

### 2. Advanced Probability Modifiers
```sql
SELECT 
    skill_id,
    skill_type,
    pierce_lv_weight,
    resis_lv_weight,
    int_weight,
    mr_weight,
    default_probability,
    min_probability,
    max_probability
FROM probability_by_spell
```

### 3. Comprehensive Probability Formula
```sql
DROP_PROBABILITY = BASE_CHANCE * (
    1 + SKILL_MODIFIER +
    RESISTANCE_MODIFIER +
    INTELLIGENCE_MODIFIER +
    MAGIC_RESISTANCE_MODIFIER
)
```

## III. Detailed Probability Analysis

### Monster-Specific Drop Probability Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
    d.mobId,
    n.desc_kr AS monster_name,
    d.itemId,
    i.desc_kr AS item_name,
    d.chance AS base_chance,
    n.lvl AS monster_level,
    CASE 
        WHEN d.chance > 100000 THEN 'Guaranteed Drop'
        WHEN d.chance > 50000 THEN 'Very High Drop Rate'
        WHEN d.chance > 10000 THEN 'High Drop Rate'
        WHEN d.chance > 1000 THEN 'Medium Drop Rate'
        ELSE 'Low Drop Rate'
    END AS drop_rate_category
FROM droplist d
JOIN npc n ON d.mobId = n.npcid
JOIN (
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr 
    FROM weapon 
    UNION 
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr FROM armor 
    UNION 
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr FROM etcitem
) i ON d.itemId = i.item_id
```

## IV. Probability Modification Factors

### 1. Skill-Based Probability Modifications
```sql
SELECT 
    skill_id,
    skill_type,
    pierce_lv_weight AS pierce_modifier,
    resis_lv_weight AS resistance_modifier,
    int_weight AS intelligence_modifier,
    mr_weight AS magic_resistance_modifier
FROM probability_by_spell
```

### 2. NPC-Level Impact on Drop Rates
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(chance) AS average_drop_chance,
    MIN(chance) AS minimum_drop_chance,
    MAX(chance) AS maximum_drop_chance,
    CORR(n.lvl, d.chance) AS level_drop_correlation
FROM droplist d
JOIN npc n ON d.mobId = n.npcid
```

## V. Rare Item Drop Mechanics

### Rare Item Probability Calculation
```sql
SELECT 
    d.itemId,
    i.desc_kr AS item_name,
    d.chance,
    n.desc_kr AS monster_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN d.chance < 100 THEN 'Extremely Rare'
        WHEN d.chance < 1000 THEN 'Very Rare'
        WHEN d.chance < 10000 THEN 'Rare'
        ELSE 'Common'
    END AS rarity_category
FROM droplist d
JOIN npc n ON d.mobId = n.npcid
JOIN (
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr FROM weapon 
    UNION 
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr FROM armor 
    UNION 
    SELECT item_id, desc_kr FROM etcitem
) i ON d.itemId = i.item_id
WHERE d.chance < 10000  -- Focus on rare drops
ORDER BY d.chance ASC
```

    player_skills, 
    player_resistances
):
    # Base probability calculation
    probability = base_chance / 100000
    
    # Skill modifier
    skill_modifier = calculate_skill_impact(player_skills)
    
    # Resistance modifier
    resistance_modifier = calculate_resistance_impact(player_resistances)
    
    # Level scaling
    level_modifier = calculate_level_scaling(monster_level)
    
    # Final probability
    final_probability = probability * (
        1 + skill_modifier + 
        resistance_modifier + 
        level_modifier
    )
    
    return min(final_probability, 1.0)  # Cap at 100%
```
